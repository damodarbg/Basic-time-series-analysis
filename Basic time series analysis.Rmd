data("AirPassengers")

## chcecking the data
class(AirPassengers)

AirPassengers
## checking structure of the data
str(AirPassengers)
## checking frequency of the data
frequency(AirPassengers)
## checking from which year data is available?

## plotting the data
plot(AirPassengers)

## drawing the vest fitting line on data which is nothing but a regression line
abline(reg =lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers)))

plot(aggregate(AirPassengers,FUN = mean))
boxplot(AirPassengers~cycle(AirPassengers))

## making mean and variance is constant to makee the data stationary

plot(diff(log(AirPassengers)))

## AR I MA
## p  d  q

Acf(AirPassengers)
Acf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))  ## determines q value  it is 0 becz 1st inverted line is 1st lie after 0 we consider 0 as q value

Pacf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))  ## determines p value it is 0 follow above rule

## fitting the model

fit = arima(log(AirPassengers), c(0,1,1), seasonal = list(order = c(0,1,1),period = 12))

pred = predict(fit,n.ahead = 2*12)

## testing the model

dataset = ts(AirPassengers, frequency = 12, start = c(1949,1), end = c(1951,12))
